It consists of three main components: a message broker, event publishers, and subscribers, which together serve as the backbone for event exchange within different services.\nMessage brokers facilitate asynchronous communications between services, meaning the sending service doesn't have to wait for the receiving service's response. Multiple services can talk to each other directly, even if they are written in different languages.\nA great example of such a message broker is Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform thousands of companies use for their event-driven system. Here, a distributed event streaming platform is a system that operates on multiple nodes, providing high availability and fault tolerance.\nPublisher/Subscriber (Pub/Sub) is a typical model in EDAs, providing flexible coupling between publishers and subscribers. In this model, those who send event notifications act as publishers, while those who receive the notifications act as the corresponding subscribers.\nCreate AsyncAPI document for Kafka messages\nIn this section, you’ll create an AsyncAPI document to describe the UserSignUp API.

Here the the APIs title, version, and description are being defined.\n\n\nThe server field specifies the details of the server, including the host, description, and the protocol that is being used (i.e., Kafka). This section allows you to define multiple clusters or servers, as shown in the provided code block.\n\n\nRememberIf an application has multiple servers hidden from the user behind a load balancer, then only the address of the load balancer must be included in the AsyncAPI document.\nDefine channels\nNext, let's move on to the channels section. The channel addresses are the topics in Kafka; they are the routes to which your API will send/receive messages.\n1channels:\n2  userSignedUp:\n3    description: This channel contains a message per each user who signs up in our application.\n4    address: user_signedup\n5    messages:\n6      userSignedUp:\n7        $ref: '#/components/messages/userSignedUp'\nIn the above code snippet:\n\nThe userSignedUp object inside channels describes the Kafka topic where the application will receive the information and the associated message definition.\nThe address field represents the actual name of the Kafka topic and the messages field describes the expected messages in that topic.\n\nDefine operations\nNow, let's move on to the operations section. The operations property is used to describe how your application interacts with the defined channels.\n1operations:\n2  onUserSignedUp:\n3    action: receive\n4    channel:\n5      $ref: '#/channels/userSignedUp'\nIn the above code snippet:\n\nThe onUserSignedUp object specifies the operation's nature, which occurs when the user signs up.\nThe action property indicates that the application will receive the information.\nThe channel property points to the channel where the operation occurs.\n\nDefine messages and schemas\nFinally, you'll define the messages and their payload. The payload defines how the event would look like when it's sent from the channel.\n1components:\n2  messages:\n3    userSignedUp:\n4      payload:\n5        type: object\n6        properties:\n7          userId:\n8            type: integer\n9            description: This property describes the ID of the user\n10          userEmail:\n11            type: string\n12            description: This property describes the Email of the user\nIn the above code snippet:\n\n\nThe userSignedUp message is defined which describes the payload (content) of the message.\n\n\nThe payload property defines the message content. Your message payload should contain a userId, an integer, a userEmail property, and a string property.\n\n\nSummary\nThe ability to generate an AsyncAPI document for Kafka is now in your toolkit. You generated an AsyncAPI document that defines the structure of the Kafka messages in a machine-readable format, which makes it easier to maintain event-driven architecture. Try adding your business logic and playing around with it.\nNext steps\nNow that you know how to write an AsyncAPI document for Kafka messages using the default schema, let's learn how to create an AsyncAPI document using Avro Schema instead.",

        "text": "Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design pattern that revolves around the production, detection, and reaction to events over time. It consists of three main components: a message broker, event publishers, and subscribers, which together serve as the backbone for event exchange within different services.Message brokers facilitate asynchronous communications between services, meaning the sending service doesn't have to wait for the receiving service's response. Multiple services can talk to each other directly, even if they are written in different languages.A great example of such a message broker is Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform thousands of companies use for their event-driven system. Here, a distributed event streaming platform is a system that operates on multiple nodes, providing high availability and fault tolerance.Publisher/Subscriber (Pub/Sub) is a typical model in EDAs, providing flexible coupling between publishers and subscribers. In this model, those who send event notifications act as publishers, while those who receive the notifications act as the corresponding subscribers."
